Instructions:

Steps to be followed to run the script and highlight the parking space which are empty as well as occupied:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook
2. Create a folder named "Origin_Images" and place the Input Images of parking space.
3. Create a folder named "canny edges" and place the images been uploaded at the location "https://github.com/Shabir1386/smartwayofparking/tree/master/canny%20edges"
4. Create a folder named "Spots" and place the images been uploaded at the location "https://github.com/Shabir1386/smartwayofparking/tree/master/Spots"
5. Upload the appropriate JSON file. (For example: UFPR05_105.json)
6. Upload the emptyData JSON file. (UFPR05_emptyData.json)
7. Upload parksmart.ipynb
8. Run parksmart.ipynb
9. Verify the root dir of Jupyter Notebook where you will observe 2 different set of images been created.
   For example, as below
   i)  Origin_Images\1366033202.jpg
   ii) Output_Images\1366033202.jpg
10. Image created starting as Output_Images has the prediction of parking slot availability highlighted as described below
   i)  Red color is for highligthing the parking lot which is occupied
   ii) Green color is for highlighting the parking lot which is not occupied
  
NOTE: JSON file been uploaded for the script is crucial in the prediction of the parking lot availablity
